Internal competitive intelligence for xAI / SpaceXAI product, GTM, and leadership. Every seeded claim should be re-verified against primary sources before executive decisions.

## Executive summary

Western competitors have moved from model releases alone into **desktop Work super-apps**, **funded partner channels**, **coding-agent packaging**, and **hardware amplification**. Chinese labs are shipping **open-weight MoE frontier models** at high cadence and low cost. Grok has strong models (4.5), Grok Build, Imagine, and real enterprise identity features — gaps are primarily **packaging, visibility, channel, desktop, and Cursor productization**.

## Operating cadence

| Cadence | Action |
|---|---|
| Daily | `npm run collect` — hash product/docs/pricing pages; write alerts on change |
| Weekly | Full feature audit — update `data/seed/baseline-*.yaml` matrix cells; re-seed |
| Real-time | Watch key lab blogs + X; critical events → `events` table |
| Quarterly | Earnings deep-dive (Alphabet, MSFT, AMZN, Meta); refresh financial_signals |

## How to maintain

1. Edit curated YAML under `data/seed/` (diffable, reviewable).
2. `npm run seed` reloads SQLite.
3. `npm run dev` opens the dashboard at http://localhost:3456.
4. Collectors never auto-overwrite gaps/matrix (proposal mode / events only).
